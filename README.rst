    <strong>NApp that manages the network topology</strong>

    <h3><a href="https://kytos-ng.github.io/api/topology.html">OpenAPI Docs</a></h3>
  </div>


Overview
========

This NApp is responsible for tracking the network topology and supplying
network topology information to any NApp that requires it.

This NApp intends to be protocol agnostic. Therefore, if you want to provide
network topology data from any network protocol, check the listened events
section and generate them from your NApp.

Installing
==========

To install this NApp, first, make sure to have the same venv activated as you have ``kytos`` installed on:

.. code:: shell

   $ git clone https://github.com/kytos-ng/topology.git
   $ cd topology
   $ python3 -m pip install --editable .

To install the kytos environment, please follow our
`development environment setup <https://github.com/kytos-ng/documentation/blob/master/tutorials/napps/development_environment_setup.rst>`_.

Requirements
============

- `kytos/of_core <https://github.com/kytos-ng/of_core.git>`_
- `MongoDB <https://github.com/kytos-ng/kytos#how-to-use-with-mongodb>`_
