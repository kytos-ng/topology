All notable changes to the ``topology`` project will be documented in this file.

[UNRELEASED] - Under development
********************************

[2024.1.4] - 2024-10-08
***********************

Changed
=======
- UI: topology link now asks for confirmation when enabling/disabling

[2024.1.3] - 2024-09-13
***********************

Changed
=======
- Combined  ``interruption.start`` and ``interruption.end`` handlers to use a single event ``interruption.(start|end)`` handler. The new handler is also uses the ``dynamic_single`` pool when processing events to ensure in order processing.

[2024.1.2] - 2024-09-10
***********************

Fixed
=====
- Fixed link down thread safety notification issue

Added
=====
- Included link changed status log info for correlation

[2024.1.1] - 2024-08-23
***********************

Fixed
=====
- Update ``interface_detail`` document in the DB can handle multiple and fast changes.
  
[2024.1.0] - 2024-07-23
***********************

Added
=====
- Added endpoint ``DELETE v3/interfaces/{interface_id}`` to delete an interface.
- Added confirmation windown to confirm the disabling or enabling of a switch in the UI interface.

Changed
=======
- Updated python environment installation from 3.9 to 3.11
- After ``*.*.switch.interface.deleted`` event, the interface, if not used, will be automatically removed from memory.
- Upgraded UI framework to Vue3

[2023.2.0] - 2024-02-16
***********************

Added
=====
- Added endpoint ``POST v3/interfaces/{interface_id}/tag_ranges`` to set ``tag_ranges`` to interfaces.
- Added endpoint ``DELETE v3/interfaces/{interface_id}/tag_ranges`` to delete ``tag_ranges`` from interfaces.
- Added endpoint ``GET v3/interfaces/{interface_id}/tag_ranges`` to get ``available_tags`` and ``tag_ranges`` from an interface.
- Added endpoint ``GET v3/interfaces/tag_ranges`` to get ``available_tags`` and ``tag_ranges`` from all interfaces.
- Added ``Tag_ranges`` documentation to openapi.yml
- Added API request POST and DELETE to modify ``Interface.tag_ranges``
- Added listener for ``kytos/core.interface_tags`` event to save any changes made to ``Interface`` attributes ``tag_ranges`` and ``available_tags``
- Added script ``special_vlan_allocation.py`` to add ``special_available_tags`` and ``special_tags`` fields to ``interface_details`` collection.
- Added endpoint ``POST v3/interfaces/{interface_id}/special_tags`` to set ``special_tags`` to interfaces.
- Added endpoint ``DELETE v3/links/{link_id}`` to delete a disabled link. To avoid rediscovery, the link needs to be physically disconnected or both interface ends (switches) need to be disabled.
- Added endpoint ``DELETE /v3/switches/{dpid}`` to delete a disabled switch. This endpoint is for decommissioned switches. The switch will get rediscovered if it reconnects to the controller. So, after deleting a switch on ``topology``, you're expected to also remove the TCP connection configuration on the switch.
- Added ``Delete`` button to delete switch in the switch panel UI interface.
- Added ``Delete`` button to delete link in the link panel UI interface.

Deprecated
==========
- Deleted event listener for ``kytos/.*.link_available_tags`` event

Removed
=======

Fixed
=====
- An interface cannot be enabled if its switch is disabled.
- Handled deactivated interfaces when an interface gets created.
- Allowed interface speed to be null on ``switches`` collection

Security
========

Changed
=======
- An interface can't be enabled if its switch is disabled.
- A link can't be enabled if its interface is disabled.
- Enabling interface can't not longer enabled its link. To enable a link, the endpoint ``POST v3/links/{link_id}/enable`` should be used.
- If a KytosEvent can't be put on ``buffers.app`` during ``setup()``, it'll make the NApp to fail to start

General Information
===================
- ``scripts/vlan_pool.py`` can be used to change the collection ``interface_details`` to have ``available_tags`` and ``tag_ranges``

[2023.1.0] - 2023-06-26
***********************

Added
=====
 - Info on status and status_reason to UI for Switches and Interfaces
 - Listener for service interruptions through ``topology.interruption.(start|end)``

- Removed ``kytos/topology.get``

General Information
===================
- ``@rest`` endpoints are now run by ``starlette/uvicorn`` instead of ``flask/werkzeug``.
- Added ``scripts/unset_active.py`` to ``$unset`` ``active`` from ``links`` and ``switches`` collections that will no longer be in the database. If you are upgrading to ``2023.1`` you should run this script, however, if you don't, it'll still work as intended since the application won't read from or update these ``active`` values

- Hooked ``link_status_hook_link_up_timer`` to update ``status`` accordingly.

Fixed
=====
- Fixed link up to only notify when ``LINK_UP_TIMER`` has passed
- Load interfaces as inactive
- Created interface should only be activated if it's active
- Fixed ``last_status_is_active`` when both interfaces go down to notify only once

Changed
=======
